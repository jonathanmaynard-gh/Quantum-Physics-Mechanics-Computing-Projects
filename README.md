A visualization of the one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator, showing energy eigenstates, probability densities, and time evolution of quantum states.

### [2D Quantum Tunneling Through Potential Barrier](./2D%20Quantum%20Tunneling%20Through%20Potential%20Barrier/)

![2D Quantum Tunneling Visualization](./2D%20Quantum%20Tunneling%20Through%20Potential%20Barrier/re3.gif)

An interactive visualization demonstrating quantum tunneling phenomena in two dimensions, showing how quantum particles can penetrate barriers that would be impenetrable in classical physics.

### [2D Quantum Harmonic Oscillator Visualizer](./2D%20Quantum%20Harmonic%20Oscillator%20Visualizer/)

![2D Quantum Harmonic Oscillator Visualization](./2D%20Quantum%20Harmonic%20Oscillator%20Visualizer/re4.gif)

An interactive visualization of quantum mechanical states in a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator potential, demonstrating fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics through wave function animations.

## Common Features

All projects in this repository:

- Explore fundamental quantum mechanical principles
- Provide visual demonstrations of quantum phenomena
- Include interactive elements to explore different quantum states
- Implement numerical solutions to Schr√∂dinger equations
- Visualize probability densities and wave function dynamics

## Requirements

All projects use similar Python dependencies:

numpy
matplotlib
scipy
```

## Usage

Each project contains its own `test.py` file that can be run to start the visualization:

```bash
python test.py
```
